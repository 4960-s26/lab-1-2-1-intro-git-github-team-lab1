"git commit" starts the process to uploading changes, before uploading with "git push"
commits are formatted in a tree, with each commit having a link to the commit that it was based on
branches can point to specific commits, allowing you to select specific parts of the commit tree and push to them
these branches can be merged back into one, e.g. making a testing branch, then after testing merging it into main

remotes are git repositories stored on a local machine that can be accessed from the internet, e.g. github repositories are all remote
"git clone" downloads a remote copy of a repo and attaches it to the original
"git fetch" downloads new commits for a remote repo and updates the head, synchronizing the remote repo
it does not update the files themselves, it just downloads the commits and changes in the files so that git can update those files if you want

"git pull" is a shorthand for "git fetch" then "git merge", downloading any new changes and merging them with the local changes
"git push" uploads commits to the remote repo
